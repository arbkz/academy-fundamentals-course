<p>In this short video, I'll show you how CrateDB fits seamlessly into a wider ecosystem of third party tools and frameworks. Many of these integrations are made possible through CrateDB's adoption of the PostgreSQL wire protocol.</p>
<p>This is a huge topic, and I'll only be able to scratch the surface here. If you're interested in a specific integration that's not mentioned in this video, check out the associated resources, which include links to the relevant parts of the documentation containing much more detail.</p>
<p>Let's spend a few minutes reviewing some of the most popular tools and integrations. As CrateDB uses standard SQL to insert, update, and query data, it's a natural fit into a wide ecosystem of tools, frameworks, and programming languages, streaming data can be ingested and indexed at speed from message brokers such as Kafka or Apache Flink, as well as MQTT brokers including HiveMQ.</p>
<p>CrateDB fits into your workflow when using platforms such as Apache Airflow, and of course, many other tools and platforms that support Postgres will also work with CrateDB. Once stored in CrateDB, data can be accessed from a wide variety of tools and frameworks. These include popular visualisation tools such as Grafana, Tableau, and Power BI. And don't forget that with drivers and SDKs for all of the popular programming languages, you can also easily integrate CrateDB into your own applications.</p>
<p>We've spoken about CrateDB's Postgres compatibility a lot here, but don't forget that there's also the http://-endpoint that opens up more integration possibilities, especially for bulk data ingest.</p>
<p>For the remainder of this video, I'll show you how to access data in CrateDB from a few popular tools that you might already be familiar with. CrateDB has its own command line tool Crash and is also compatible with the Postgres "psql" command line interface. Sometimes you want to take a more graphical approach to managing your databases. Here I've connected the popular DBeaver tool to CrateDB and you can see the data contained in the taxis table from our Chicago data set. If you have a preferred database management tool that supports Postgres, you should be able to use it with CrateDB.</p>
<p>Application developers will be pleased to know that you can access data in CrateDB directly from many popular IDEs. Here I'm running a query that summarises data in the <span style="font-family: terminal, monospace;">taxis</span> table from a Chicago sample data set, and I'm doing it right here inside the popular VSCode IDE using Microsoft's Postgres extension.</p>
<p>Grafana is a popular visualisation and dashboard creation tool. You can use Grafana both to understand the performance of your CrateDB cluster and to visualise data stored in the database. This dashboard shows a map of all of the open street light issues in Chicago using data from the <span style="font-family: terminal, monospace;">three_eleven_calls</span> table. And here's the simple SQL query that powers it. You can add data from a CrateDB cluster to Grafana using Grafana's Postgres data source plug in.</p>
<p>And finally, don't forget that there are drivers and SDK's for most popular programming languages. Several languages have multiple options depending on your coding style and the level of abstraction you're working at. Here are some examples for Python, Node.js, Java, .net, Go, and PHP.</p>
<p>In this video I only have time to scratch the surface of what's possible when integrating CrateDB with party tools and systems. Hopefully I've given you a flavour of what you can do. For more detail including many more integrations not covered here, you should check out the online documentation and resources associated with this video.</p>
