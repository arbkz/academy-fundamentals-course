<p>In this module, we'll focus on data modelling with CrateDB. We'll begin by covering primitive data types, then move quickly onto more advanced topics including time series and document data.</p>
<p>We'll also look at vector similarity search. Last but not least, you'll learn about CrateDB's support for geospatial data. These modules include hands on exercises, giving you the opportunity to explore these concepts in your own CrateDB cluster.</p>
