00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.000
In this video we'll cover some
aspects of monitoring the

3bb16ffe-6044-4275-a9fb-a5a06a205c7c-1
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.361
behaviour of your CrateDB
cluster and understanding how

3bb16ffe-6044-4275-a9fb-a5a06a205c7c-2
00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:12.600
queries are executed.

d144cfff-cbd8-4815-ac4d-ecfd6555bd85-0
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.149
I'll also show you how CrateDB
can be used as a long term

d144cfff-cbd8-4815-ac4d-ecfd6555bd85-1
00:00:17.149 --> 00:00:20.362
storage, analysis and
visualisation platform for

d144cfff-cbd8-4815-ac4d-ecfd6555bd85-2
00:00:20.362 --> 00:00:23.838
metrics gathered from other
systems via Telegraf or

d144cfff-cbd8-4815-ac4d-ecfd6555bd85-3
00:00:23.838 --> 00:00:24.560
Prometheus.

60146151-63ea-4bed-a401-f3f47d24cbbc-0
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.400
Let's jump right in.

129e4f32-b0a8-4574-86de-c24a0759a474-0
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.952
You can monitor the behaviour of
a CrateDB cluster using JMX

129e4f32-b0a8-4574-86de-c24a0759a474-1
00:00:32.952 --> 00:00:35.040
Java Management Extensions.

081b8552-2b27-4577-9aa7-14767b6dac4d-0
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.400
I'll demonstrate this using a
Docker image.

6e2eb770-08d3-46f4-a276-9d2ca889b8e5-0
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.848
This command starts a single
node cluster with some

6e2eb770-08d3-46f4-a276-9d2ca889b8e5-1
00:00:42.848 --> 00:00:44.920
additional configuration for
JMX.

ab810bf8-23d8-47c8-874b-b024117e42db-0
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.120
We'll use port 7979 as the
remote JMX port.

c75708b4-0874-478f-8af9-34e3622e7f45-0
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.382
JConsole is a basic graphical
application supplied with Java

c75708b4-0874-478f-8af9-34e3622e7f45-1
00:00:56.382 --> 00:00:58.640
that can connect to a JMX agent.

c34c4f4d-7250-4eb8-bb2d-05da08578105-0
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.499
I'm connecting it to port 7979
so that it can attach to the

c34c4f4d-7250-4eb8-bb2d-05da08578105-1
00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:07.680
agent running in the CrateDB
docker instance.

5664f806-e4a5-4237-845a-6c30ba32a9a5-0
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.425
Once connected, JConsole starts
to display metrics from the

5664f806-e4a5-4237-845a-6c30ba32a9a5-1
00:01:13.425 --> 00:01:15.760
CrateDB node running inside
Docker.

f1820d72-b553-4866-bb60-ea7740642333-0
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.240
Here we see an overview.

c64b0657-6740-4b27-83fd-198384e92044-0
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.887
We can also focus on memory
usage, and finally we can drill

c64b0657-6740-4b27-83fd-198384e92044-1
00:01:23.887 --> 00:01:27.520
down into the details of each
thread in the JVM.

52a9fafa-53df-47e1-855e-d9c296525f74-0
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.897
The CrateDB admin interface
has an overview screen that

52a9fafa-53df-47e1-855e-d9c296525f74-1
00:01:33.897 --> 00:01:37.120
allows you to monitor key
operational statistics.

b771c5a7-262b-44fc-8daf-4c2061a8fdfd-0
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.740
Scrolling down, we see live
charts that show data pertaining

b771c5a7-262b-44fc-8daf-4c2061a8fdfd-1
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.680
to query speed.

4f6f3533-87f9-474d-9af9-5b0f966b0720-0
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.157
These are displayed as an
overall value as well as by type

4f6f3533-87f9-474d-9af9-5b0f966b0720-1
00:01:49.157 --> 00:01:52.800
of query: selects, inserts,
updates and deletes.

ad20c71a-8025-41d6-8447-f455b383c666-0
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.626
Another tool that's available to
you when monitoring the

ad20c71a-8025-41d6-8447-f455b383c666-1
00:01:58.626 --> 00:02:02.080
performance of your CrateDB
cluster is the EXPLAIN command.

f02a600d-2af1-4957-a96d-dc15a8ce7c8d-0
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.449
This command displays the
execution plan for a given

f02a600d-2af1-4957-a96d-dc15a8ce7c8d-1
00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:06.840
query.

116c96ef-dbf0-42f0-967e-6340f53074bd-0
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.833
Invoke it by prepending EXPLAIN
to the query you want to

116c96ef-dbf0-42f0-967e-6340f53074bd-1
00:02:11.833 --> 00:02:12.400
analyse.

7f93d51f-9e43-4cc8-b327-59eb63c65130-0
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.098
Here I'm analysing a SELECT
query that uses our 311 call

7f93d51f-9e43-4cc8-b327-59eb63c65130-1
00:02:18.098 --> 00:02:21.560
data, and here's the plan for
that query.

56c5b4f3-7417-445a-8fc5-195ccdb73dbc-0
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.316
Please refer to the
documentation for the EXPLAIN

56c5b4f3-7417-445a-8fc5-195ccdb73dbc-1
00:02:25.316 --> 00:02:27.560
command to understand the output
here.

6c3d7056-10d4-4034-bc45-6f367bbe8230-0
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.560
There's also a verbose mode that
returns additional details.

b5d1d1e5-c7be-46f5-b5d7-e5a950b5f98f-0
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.280
Use it by prepending your query
with EXPLAIN VERBOSE.

701282ae-75b8-4433-8b06-a8ae5dbb5d54-0
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.044
This returns a more human
readable version of the plan

701282ae-75b8-4433-8b06-a8ae5dbb5d54-1
00:02:42.044 --> 00:02:45.170
with a breakdown of the steps
performed by the query

701282ae-75b8-4433-8b06-a8ae5dbb5d54-2
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.760
optimizer.

625dd250-c0cb-4920-991a-7f947ff0f163-0
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.960
Finally, there's a third
variant, EXPLAIN ANALYZE.

8c95918b-a94f-47f1-814d-e74335f7cea3-0
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.689
In this case the plan is
executed and the timings

8c95918b-a94f-47f1-814d-e74335f7cea3-1
00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:57.760
associated with the different
phases are returned.

8fc836fd-f079-454a-b463-6e3ed2a2c17f-0
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.577
To learn more about the output
here, please consult the EXPLAIN

documentation in the CrateDB
documentation portal.

1c5345be-dde8-4ab6-a32c-87489b01036a-0
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.575
CrateDB also makes an excellent
data store and analysis platform

1c5345be-dde8-4ab6-a32c-87489b01036a-1
00:03:11.575 --> 00:03:14.640
for metrics data generated by
other systems.

227f5fcb-7311-4e47-ba59-3f2f690a0b17-0
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.308
Let's see how this works for two
popular solutions, Telegraf and

227f5fcb-7311-4e47-ba59-3f2f690a0b17-1
00:03:19.308 --> 00:03:19.960
Prometheus.

a096c5fd-54e6-40e0-b089-64fd7e72d679-0
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.160
Telegraf is a server based
agent for collecting metrics and

a096c5fd-54e6-40e0-b089-64fd7e72d679-1
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.320
sending them for further
processing.

cf13c56c-05f0-40ed-a887-6d6160dd0ebd-0
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.661
These metrics originate from a
variety of data sources, for

cf13c56c-05f0-40ed-a887-6d6160dd0ebd-1
00:03:32.661 --> 00:03:37.762
example via HTTP, from sensors,
perhaps via MQTT, or from cloud

cf13c56c-05f0-40ed-a887-6d6160dd0ebd-2
00:03:37.762 --> 00:03:38.480
services.

e3079be1-638a-478c-bcf7-a21d82c1bfe7-0
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.033
These are sent to Telegraf
which uses its plug in

e3079be1-638a-478c-bcf7-a21d82c1bfe7-1
00:03:43.033 --> 00:03:47.120
architecture to ingest, process,
aggregate and output data.

d8611c9f-1909-40ca-8e0a-99d9c12c5488-0
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.242
Metrics can then be stored in
CrateDB using Telegraf's

d8611c9f-1909-40ca-8e0a-99d9c12c5488-1
00:03:52.242 --> 00:03:53.760
Postgres output plug in.

763f7bdd-1068-49b2-a2db-72eed37a3eb9-0
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.974
It's a simple matter of
connecting the plug in with the

763f7bdd-1068-49b2-a2db-72eed37a3eb9-1
00:03:57.974 --> 00:04:00.240
connection URL for the CrateDB
cluster.

51862b4e-7120-4bc8-abf7-35437aec803e-0
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.225
Once the data's in CrateDB,
you can use standard SQL to

51862b4e-7120-4bc8-abf7-35437aec803e-1
00:04:05.225 --> 00:04:08.725
analyse it, as well as
leveraging popular visualisation

51862b4e-7120-4bc8-abf7-35437aec803e-2
00:04:08.725 --> 00:04:12.600
tools such as Grafana to build
custom dashboards of your own.

852bcd6b-30bb-424c-9ea3-6b187ad82ec9-0
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.734
Prometheus is an open source
systems monitoring and alerting

852bcd6b-30bb-424c-9ea3-6b187ad82ec9-1
00:04:18.734 --> 00:04:19.240
toolkit.

2174a9b5-7d24-4fac-a082-2200aa3a08bd-0
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.600
It collects and stores metrics
data.

7d482639-78a4-4476-92d9-adff2d68a831-0
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.400
It's great for short term
storage and using the CrateDB

7d482639-78a4-4476-92d9-adff2d68a831-1
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.800
Prometheus adaptor.

5ae484bd-4e6f-46d1-8e8a-2dfbb668a71e-0
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.489
This metrics data can seamlessly
flow into CrateDB where it can

5ae484bd-4e6f-46d1-8e8a-2dfbb668a71e-1
00:04:33.489 --> 00:04:38.139
be stored long term and accessed
using the power of CrateDB SQL

5ae484bd-4e6f-46d1-8e8a-2dfbb668a71e-2
00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:38.639
engine.

0a969fd0-1130-4655-bfa7-3fd016c5ae98-0
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.708
Of course, you can also still
use standard tools such as

0a969fd0-1130-4655-bfa7-3fd016c5ae98-1
00:04:43.708 --> 00:04:46.447
Grafana to build custom
dashboards and other

0a969fd0-1130-4655-bfa7-3fd016c5ae98-2
00:04:46.447 --> 00:04:47.359
visualizations.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.493
You should now have a high level
understanding of how to monitor

942699e0-0c5d-4071-8cfa-e69bf2093b3f-1
00:04:53.493 --> 00:04:56.480

into query behaviour.

ba11c1f2-d23d-4f49-ad42-678f6dda1abd-0
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.369
We also showed you how to use
CrateDB as an analytics

ba11c1f2-d23d-4f49-ad42-678f6dda1abd-1
00:05:00.369 --> 00:05:04.000
database for monitoring the
behaviour of other systems with

ba11c1f2-d23d-4f49-ad42-678f6dda1abd-2
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.814
metrics collected by standard
frameworks such as Telegraf and

ba11c1f2-d23d-4f49-ad42-678f6dda1abd-3
00:05:07.814 --> 00:05:08.479
