00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.183
Let's learn how to get CrateDB
running on your local machine

efd1b41b-72c8-49f9-94d9-e6dca96b61f8-1
00:00:07.183 --> 00:00:07.960
using Docker.

4aad0d03-aca5-4de1-aba7-b0a6635afc7a-0
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.997
We'll start at the CrateDB
website and you'll want to click

4aad0d03-aca5-4de1-aba7-b0a6635afc7a-1
00:00:11.997 --> 00:00:15.040
this Get Started button in the
top right hand corner.

b8386a8c-fe1e-4d6a-a991-74886fff365e-0
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.667
From there we want to choose a
self deployment option and click

b8386a8c-fe1e-4d6a-a991-74886fff365e-1
00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:20.200
Download.

87e963f5-7776-474e-a952-2525bfeaf8f3-0
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.926
Now we click Docker and this
takes us to the CrateDB docs

87e963f5-7776-474e-a952-2525bfeaf8f3-1
00:00:25.926 --> 00:00:28.200
portal to the quick start page

1ed708a0-602f-4746-97f4-20994fc83ec1-0
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.960
for Docker. This is a quick
start,

ab2fed87-7be7-4b2c-88e5-cdd378f23d72-0
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.747
it doesn't cover complexities
such as scaling your cluster or

ab2fed87-7be7-4b2c-88e5-cdd378f23d72-1
00:00:34.747 --> 00:00:35.480
persistence.

5c675aef-b90e-423e-9895-7a755372a1cf-0
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.569
We have a separate guide for
that and that will be the

5c675aef-b90e-423e-9895-7a755372a1cf-1
00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:40.400
subject of a separate tutorial
video.

6b0143b5-3acd-405b-8097-695dc9aa5aee-0
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.191
So for now, what we want to do
is make sure that Docker Desktop

6b0143b5-3acd-405b-8097-695dc9aa5aee-1
00:00:45.191 --> 00:00:46.280
is up and running.

34394e96-ef9e-4ec1-9cbd-47b38fd03aba-0
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.240
If you don't have this, you can
download it from Docker.

cb938224-f9a5-4df8-b297-c0d0b6ba939d-0
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.111
And having ensured that that's
up and running, it's then a

cb938224-f9a5-4df8-b297-c0d0b6ba939d-1
00:00:54.111 --> 00:00:58.278
simple case of copying this
command here that we've provided

cb938224-f9a5-4df8-b297-c0d0b6ba939d-2
00:00:58.278 --> 00:01:01.080
in the guide and moving to the
terminal.

3d31b73f-dec1-42ca-8510-eaf8d3b25f46-0
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.390
We can then paste that and when
we hit return, what will happen

3d31b73f-dec1-42ca-8510-eaf8d3b25f46-1
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.290
is this is going to pull the
image from the Docker Hub and

3d31b73f-dec1-42ca-8510-eaf8d3b25f46-2
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.191
then it's going to start a
container for it locally on our

3d31b73f-dec1-42ca-8510-eaf8d3b25f46-3
00:01:13.191 --> 00:01:13.719
machine.

2cbb7408-c0ad-4021-be0e-2e8fbdc947a8-0
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.624
We're also publishing a couple
of ports there, 5432 for

2cbb7408-c0ad-4021-be0e-2e8fbdc947a8-1
00:01:18.624 --> 00:01:22.360
Postgres and 4200 for the create
admin interface.

c29df229-fa01-4b2b-96b6-f14c940f4a5d-0
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.680
So looks like things are up and
running, so output has finished.

6b87e6c0-9c66-4d09-868c-853ab7cf5209-0
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.681
What we're going to do now is go
to local host 4200 and have a

6b87e6c0-9c66-4d09-868c-853ab7cf5209-1
00:01:33.681 --> 00:01:36.360
look at the CrateDB admin
interface.

2d3668b4-9b9d-4dc6-aaa8-57e93a8b64a0-0
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.360
So here we see what happens when
we visit local host 4200.

da22ff72-00cd-4590-bfdd-b8eaf99d4414-0
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.436
We can verify that CrateDB is up
and running and the health of

da22ff72-00cd-4590-bfdd-b8eaf99d4414-1
00:01:44.436 --> 00:01:45.840
the database is good.

6b8c4805-e193-404c-b546-68d0d49d83a6-0
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.620
We have a single node database,
so it's a basic cluster of one

6b8c4805-e193-404c-b546-68d0d49d83a6-1
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.920
node.

bc677713-700b-43e1-990f-628922339268-0
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.208
And what we can also do here is
we can click here and view the

bc677713-700b-43e1-990f-628922339268-1
00:01:55.208 --> 00:01:55.720
tables.

3eed19d7-56d3-4a83-88fa-2f8d555d90e2-0
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.701
There aren't any tables yet
because it's a brand new

3eed19d7-56d3-4a83-88fa-2f8d555d90e2-1
00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:01.932
database and we can click here
to the console and we could

3eed19d7-56d3-4a83-88fa-2f8d555d90e2-2
00:02:01.932 --> 00:02:03.520
enter some SQL statements.

4eff7d28-53b9-482d-b5a8-c066f9488894-0
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.800
You've gone ahead and installed
CrateDB into your local

4eff7d28-53b9-482d-b5a8-c066f9488894-1
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.520
environment using Docker.

8161bfab-b12c-4f01-85e0-00d12a296bce-0
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.640
Congratulations.
