00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.461
Here we need to store and
analyse massive volumes of

e4c72012-0cb7-409d-b77c-c1d1c98c82b4-1
00:00:24.461 --> 00:00:26.240

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.364
Here we want to handle high
velocity data streams and

8f9ea429-c2ae-4928-9d7c-8571abca4af6-1
00:00:39.364 --> 00:00:42.873

bcbef6ea-8dcf-44ca-9f1c-eefb37f6012d-0
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.823
If you require a database that
could provide real time insight

bcbef6ea-8dcf-44ca-9f1c-eefb37f6012d-1
00:02:29.823 --> 00:02:33.404
and support for analytical
queries on large data sets then

bcbef6ea-8dcf-44ca-9f1c-eefb37f6012d-2
00:02:33.404 --> 00:02:36.925

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.717
It works well for use cases
where you have relationships

4b572ff1-29fe-4637-b844-26d7475c19c5-1
00:03:40.717 --> 00:03:44.240
between different data sets and
those are of different types.

82037608-64e4-4acb-9c4d-8f7e3874fffe-0
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.034
For example, you might have a
mix of structured, semi

82037608-64e4-4acb-9c4d-8f7e3874fffe-1
00:03:48.034 --> 00:03:50.960

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.360
When choosing CrateDB, there's
a couple of things to bear in mind.

6f66114c-06d8-4864-b2f5-72d58cde65cf-0
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.802
It's eventually consistent and
strongly consistent on primary

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.240
It favours normalised data
models.

9da31d7a-f4ba-4957-a7e4-da1784066a9b-0
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.717
When designing for CrateDB,
you'll need to keep these things

9da31d7a-f4ba-4957-a7e4-da1784066a9b-1
00:04:32.717 --> 00:04:33.120
in mind.
