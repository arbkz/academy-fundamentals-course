00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.066
In this video, I'll show you how
to connect to CrateDB and work

65c88418-eaa8-42f1-ae2a-7992003dc3f6-1
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:12.737
with data using drivers for a
selection of popular programming

65c88418-eaa8-42f1-ae2a-7992003dc3f6-2
00:00:12.737 --> 00:00:13.320
languages.

9eb6fb98-9e93-45c2-b994-c065c29f838f-0
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.260
CrateDB's support for the
PostgreSQL Wire Protocol means that

9eb6fb98-9e93-45c2-b994-c065c29f838f-1
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.280
many of these drivers may
already be familiar to you.

34eb647d-c122-4b6d-a107-d3401b9c46b1-0
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.284
You'll often have a choice of
driver for your preferred

34eb647d-c122-4b6d-a107-d3401b9c46b1-1
00:00:24.284 --> 00:00:27.620
programming language, allowing
you to pick one that best suits

34eb647d-c122-4b6d-a107-d3401b9c46b1-2
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.320
your coding style and chosen
level of abstraction.

d1713c77-c82c-4392-a993-ee98f833ba2d-0
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.280
I'll show you some code in
Python, Node.js, Java and .NET.

6a0d837d-1c97-4d4f-b3a3-f6405a7528be-0
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.360
If you're using another
language, don't worry.

b3a0f99c-2130-4152-b1e8-b475d2e056b0-0
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.534
A full list of available drivers
for many more languages,

b3a0f99c-2130-4152-b1e8-b475d2e056b0-1
00:00:43.534 --> 00:00:47.389
including Go, PHP, and others,
can be found in the online

b3a0f99c-2130-4152-b1e8-b475d2e056b0-2
00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:48.319
documentation.

6da7cd57-e78f-418d-9e8a-1582e6433a4a-0
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.507
We'll begin with a short summary
of popular driver options for

6da7cd57-e78f-418d-9e8a-1582e6433a4a-1
00:00:54.507 --> 00:00:56.120
major programming languages.

5e7b8dc1-c940-42ed-86ff-08238552368f-0
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.600
For Python, we provide our own
driver, crate-python.

f0ed48bc-a7ba-4c7b-b11e-99aa036b2501-0
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.944
If you prefer to work with
SQL, Alchemy, or Pandas,

f0ed48bc-a7ba-4c7b-b11e-99aa036b2501-1
00:01:03.944 --> 00:01:06.080
there are drivers for each of
those too.

2b6154c4-7223-4009-9867-1c9c5c2fa503-0
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.160
You'll see some example code for
these shortly.

af5428db-bb20-4b38-afd7-cde3ed0167fb-0
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.240
Node.js developers can use the
regular Postgres driver.

c10b411a-0083-4f67-ba2f-efeca6593170-0
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.694
There's also the option to use a
CrateDB specific driver that

c10b411a-0083-4f67-ba2f-efeca6593170-1
00:01:18.694 --> 00:01:21.880
connects to the cluster using
the HTTP endpoint.

b60a3f99-4943-4391-a6e4-6a66c8ea6414-0
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.037
When working in Java you can use
our JDBC driver or a

b60a3f99-4943-4391-a6e4-6a66c8ea6414-1
00:01:28.037 --> 00:01:32.890
Postgres compatible one. The .NET
framework is supported through

b60a3f99-4943-4391-a6e4-6a66c8ea6414-2
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.400
the use of the Npgsql driver.

59aeda57-340c-4cd5-9898-5ef09801426b-0
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.160
For Go Lang use pgx.

8aba682d-1bc6-4e65-8a29-35543cd87b0f-0
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.720
And finally, here are some
options for PHP developers.

812440b9-27cd-4d5b-a8e9-95ba6f9b9495-0
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.720
Here's some example code using
the crate driver for Python.

eafffac3-5525-4d3b-845c-b960591f5c8c-0
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.729
It connects to the
HTTP endpoint and I'm running

eafffac3-5525-4d3b-845c-b960591f5c8c-1
00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.120
a simple SELECT query and
displaying the result.

21295999-b191-4bec-889f-5265170d3614-0
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.128
This code runs the same query
but uses SQL Alchemy and as

21295999-b191-4bec-889f-5265170d3614-1
00:02:04.128 --> 00:02:07.320
you'd expect, it yields the same
results.

96e58fd2-758a-4b57-8d48-52ab6e68eb1d-0
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.905
The code here should be familiar
to Node.js developers already

96e58fd2-758a-4b57-8d48-52ab6e68eb1d-1
00:02:12.905 --> 00:02:14.200
working with Postgres.

2885cb92-2fb9-48b9-ac52-492f21255796-0
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.898
Using the standard Node Postgres
package, we're again creating a

2885cb92-2fb9-48b9-ac52-492f21255796-1
00:02:18.898 --> 00:02:22.510
connection, running a simple
select query, and logging the

2885cb92-2fb9-48b9-ac52-492f21255796-2
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.000
results.

a2786259-c578-49bb-9967-320d6e458c97-0
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.280
Here we're showing 2 fields from
the result object.

8ab64ce4-38a9-41cf-ac33-a1e223454296-0
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.984
rowcount tells us how many rows
were returned, and rows is an

8ab64ce4-38a9-41cf-ac33-a1e223454296-1
00:02:31.984 --> 00:02:34.720
array of objects, each
containing values.

f29a1b34-65b5-4b43-80f8-c6d7249ee1d8-0
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.176
Java developers will likely
already be familiar with the

f29a1b34-65b5-4b43-80f8-c6d7249ee1d8-1
00:02:40.176 --> 00:02:41.160
JDBC interface.

79dbf21b-c69e-4586-8177-8b3817bb87e5-0
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.119
This code uses Crate's JDBC
driver to run the same select

79dbf21b-c69e-4586-8177-8b3817bb87e5-1
00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:51.073
query that we've seen before and
as you'd expect, we get the same

79dbf21b-c69e-4586-8177-8b3817bb87e5-2
00:02:51.073 --> 00:02:52.200
sort of output.

2b6ba05c-2076-4a40-bbce-8bf4e5d7c503-0
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.040
As we saw from the other
languages.

8e8ca431-f1f7-40b2-b8c5-f99878fd8e10-0
00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.066
.NET developers can use the standard
Npgsql package that you may

8e8ca431-f1f7-40b2-b8c5-f99878fd8e10-1
00:03:01.066 --> 00:03:02.640
already be familiar with.

47784ff2-f230-4b90-86c2-7bf18fbd8993-0
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.080
Once again, we see the same sort
of output.

a28392c9-d615-4c87-bc42-e3af04e3380a-0
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.988
Hopefully you now have an idea
of how easy it is to connect

a28392c9-d615-4c87-bc42-e3af04e3380a-1
00:03:12.988 --> 00:03:16.439
CrateDB and work with data in
your application, no matter

a28392c9-d615-4c87-bc42-e3af04e3380a-2
00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:19.480
which language or languages
you're developing with.

drivers and integrations are

available for each programming
language, consult the online
