In this module, we'll focus on
data modelling with CrateDB.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.976 line:50%
We'll begin by covering
primitive data types, then move

00:00:10.976 --> 00:00:14.336 line:50%
quickly onto more advanced
topics including time series and

00:00:14.336 --> 00:00:15.120 line:50%
document data.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.240 line:50%
We'll also look at vector
similarity search.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.490 line:50%
Last but not least, you'll learn
about CrateDB's support for

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.400 line:50%
geospatial data.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.736 line:50%
These modules include hands on
exercises, giving you the

00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:31.314 line:50%
opportunity to explore these
concepts in your own CrateDB

00:00:31.314 --> 00:00:31.800 line:50%
