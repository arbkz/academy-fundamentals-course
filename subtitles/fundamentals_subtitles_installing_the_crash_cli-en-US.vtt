34affb2a-fdf8-4ed0-a6d3-003b3e0b882f-0
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.471
Hello, in this video we'll look
at Crash, a command line

34affb2a-fdf8-4ed0-a6d3-003b3e0b882f-1
00:00:07.471 --> 00:00:08.920
interface for CrateDB.

3a4b60ee-6889-488f-b900-6bbaa64139e0-0
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.920
We'll start by downloading a
copy of Crash.

cdb53b53-d0a2-4c5a-9c85-e7bae56918a9-0
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.525
Then we'll use it to connect
both to a CrateDB cluster in

cdb53b53-d0a2-4c5a-9c85-e7bae56918a9-1
00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:18.946
the cloud and one running
locally using Docker, jumping

cdb53b53-d0a2-4c5a-9c85-e7bae56918a9-2
00:00:18.946 --> 00:00:19.680
straight in.

86cc84da-4024-49e1-8938-94a2e4ffa634-0
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.921
We'll start here at the CrateDB
website and you're going to want

86cc84da-4024-49e1-8938-94a2e4ffa634-1
00:00:23.921 --> 00:00:25.400
to click documentation.

3385d37e-1dad-476a-9235-6c0c7bfdcf90-0
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.920
And then down here on the left,
there's a Crash CLI section.

64bc3c6e-14c5-437b-aad0-644f72c21804-0
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.544
Inside here, there's various
information about what Crash is

64bc3c6e-14c5-437b-aad0-644f72c21804-1
00:00:33.544 --> 00:00:34.560
and how to use it.

700e99ee-d437-4c1a-85ae-c348d060bbcf-0
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.040
We're going to want the
installation link.

b4246a9f-6969-412e-a14d-1b9421f9a239-0
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.800
There are two methods for
installing Crash.

d4cb8f50-906a-4921-b516-a53aee9264d9-0
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.813
We can either use Python's pip
package manager, which is the

d4cb8f50-906a-4921-b516-a53aee9264d9-1
00:00:44.813 --> 00:00:48.722
method that I'm going to use, or
you can download it using a curl

d4cb8f50-906a-4921-b516-a53aee9264d9-2
00:00:48.722 --> 00:00:52.335
command and then change the
permissions on that and just run

d4cb8f50-906a-4921-b516-a53aee9264d9-3
00:00:52.335 --> 00:00:53.520
it as an executable.

a6152015-6225-4a27-993b-ea77c027abd0-0
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.126
But let's go with the Python
method and I'll just click copy

a6152015-6225-4a27-993b-ea77c027abd0-1
00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:04.126
here, swap to the terminal, and
we'll paste a command there and

a6152015-6225-4a27-993b-ea77c027abd0-2
00:01:04.126 --> 00:01:06.079
off it goes and installs.

c4681b79-0fdc-45e3-9820-2eb2bb3b315a-0
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.381
Now that installed quite quickly
because I have some of these

c4681b79-0fdc-45e3-9820-2eb2bb3b315a-1
00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:11.160
dependencies cached from
beforehand.

759cfa94-df03-462e-aff7-fa9b4874bc13-0
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.065
Yours might take a moment while
it downloads some of them from

759cfa94-df03-462e-aff7-fa9b4874bc13-1
00:01:14.065 --> 00:01:14.640
the Internet.

8eae45c9-3db8-46dd-a409-53f96b1f4c1f-0
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.037
So now we've installed Crash,
let's connect to our cloud

8eae45c9-3db8-46dd-a409-53f96b1f4c1f-1
00:01:19.037 --> 00:01:19.520
cluster.

691db8ea-8a7d-4aa6-8e02-d59a10289b5c-0
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.840
What we need to do is go over
here to the Cloud Console.

d682eb45-e597-42f4-a354-a68fa5fc4034-0
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.648
So this is from when you set up
the cluster earlier, and here in

d682eb45-e597-42f4-a354-a68fa5fc4034-1
00:01:27.648 --> 00:01:30.930
the overview, you'll see down
the bottom here there's a

d682eb45-e597-42f4-a354-a68fa5fc4034-2
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.040
section connecting to your
cluster.

fcd58ecc-d29b-435f-88e6-10b0929955a0-0
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.460
Click CLI and what you'll see is
the command that we need to

fcd58ecc-d29b-435f-88e6-10b0929955a0-1
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.240
invoke Crash and pass it.

bdf8a443-0be8-46f1-b0f7-5a7b6705e119-0
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.402
The host names of the hosts,
that part of the cluster, and

bdf8a443-0be8-46f1-b0f7-5a7b6705e119-1
00:01:43.402 --> 00:01:45.440
the username that we want to
connect.

94439857-0c23-4163-8671-30c254ff7fa8-0
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.335
As we have a single node cluster
here, so there's only one host

94439857-0c23-4163-8671-30c254ff7fa8-1
00:01:49.335 --> 00:01:49.640
name.

a9b351a7-8fa8-4790-85d6-7e9c477dbe30-0
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.740
I'm going to click copy here and
then go back to the terminal and

a9b351a7-8fa8-4790-85d6-7e9c477dbe30-1
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.440
paste that command in.

be673d60-f85e-447e-8fa3-f27131004096-0
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.040
I now need to enter the password
for the admin user.

a984087a-0e4b-40be-acda-61430b900d5f-0
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.893
And with that done, we're
connected to our cluster in the

a984087a-0e4b-40be-acda-61430b900d5f-1
00:02:02.893 --> 00:02:03.160
cloud.

5c54fba6-19b6-4880-bf87-1a5bacf4ba38-0
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.240
At the CR prompt here we can
type SQL statements.

351a0dd5-a413-4323-b585-2a9d0bb0fa87-0
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.960
Let's do a simple select ID,
hostname from sys.nodes.

4bad68a1-20d1-45b2-93bd-2f253c4511a3-0
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.120
This is a table that exists
already.

7d79eed8-52cf-4c69-a45f-e3dd38ef2065-0
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.760
When we do that, you'll see we
have a single entry.

747725ff-5c5b-425a-ba84-cf09617cfdd2-0
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.240
There's just one node in our
cluster.

521fe1ec-ccc3-418c-91c2-75731322b0cd-0
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.695
If we want to look down at the
bottom there you'll see the

521fe1ec-ccc3-418c-91c2-75731322b0cd-1
00:02:26.695 --> 00:02:28.560
username that I'm connected as
admin.

ce4a25f0-c892-4758-a656-a8db7f673c94-0
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.144
The default schema that Crash
will use if we don't put a

ce4a25f0-c892-4758-a656-a8db7f673c94-1
00:02:32.144 --> 00:02:34.160
schema name in front of a table
name.

7f6b1cc0-41b5-45dd-9a18-b799f1f954a4-0
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.013
So that's doc, the cluster that
I'm connected to, my course

7f6b1cc0-41b5-45dd-9a18-b799f1f954a4-1
00:02:38.013 --> 00:02:42.058
cluster, and the host names that
form part of that are sort of

7f6b1cc0-41b5-45dd-9a18-b799f1f954a4-2
00:02:42.058 --> 00:02:43.600
over there to the right.

868f2c47-8155-4413-abaf-9df4e29be247-0
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.788
If we want to quit Crash, we
can do Control+D and return to

868f2c47-8155-4413-abaf-9df4e29be247-1
00:02:48.788 --> 00:02:50.240
the terminal prompt.

08834476-96b7-404a-a068-e941639bed16-0
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.280
So that covers the cloud
cluster.

27c17501-8e36-4691-b6d7-b12e36dc011b-0
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.273
What we want to do next is
connect to a cluster running

27c17501-8e36-4691-b6d7-b12e36dc011b-1
00:02:56.273 --> 00:02:59.000
locally with Docker in case you
chose that option.

ee6dad9c-75c1-4d5d-a5df-844793faa71e-0
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.880
So again, I'll just clear the
terminal here.

6bb12fae-994f-479d-be57-ffbed97471fd-0
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.200
And when we run the cluster on
Docker, it runs locally on our

6bb12fae-994f-479d-be57-ffbed97471fd-1
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.192
machine and it's in a container
managed by docker and it exposes

6bb12fae-994f-479d-be57-ffbed97471fd-2
00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:12.960
port 4200.

f3a16c84-f6de-4f5e-afc3-22b781e1e01e-0
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.090
So we can just use the default
settings in Crash to just type

f3a16c84-f6de-4f5e-afc3-22b781e1e01e-1
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.640
Crash and it will connect to
that local cluster.

4fbaa557-a4ad-424e-9322-60f441f6ca77-0
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.430
So as you saw before, we're now
connected, we can type the same

4fbaa557-a4ad-424e-9322-60f441f6ca77-1
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.188
SQL statement, select ID,
hostname from sys.nodes and

4fbaa557-a4ad-424e-9322-60f441f6ca77-2
00:03:32.188 --> 00:03:36.945
you'll see that again we get a
single result which is our one

4fbaa557-a4ad-424e-9322-60f441f6ca77-3
00:03:36.945 --> 00:03:38.480
node in the cluster.

430e63bd-5e0a-4b08-b3c7-f2e413073260-0
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.997
And again down the bottom there
we are connected as a user

430e63bd-5e0a-4b08-b3c7-f2e413073260-1
00:03:41.997 --> 00:03:42.640
called crate.

b991e41f-ecdf-45ed-a53e-cb0d5385a935-0
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.318
This time that user doesn't need
a password in the Docker

b991e41f-ecdf-45ed-a53e-cb0d5385a935-1
00:03:46.318 --> 00:03:47.080
environment.

14ffead1-624d-4b41-a3bd-adbeb78d66cb-0
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.073
And again, our default schema
is doc and we have a single

14ffead1-624d-4b41-a3bd-adbeb78d66cb-1
00:03:52.073 --> 00:03:56.320
host in the cluster, similarly
to before Control+D exits.

2d6e2f93-32cc-49d4-ad46-b263c3e9c4db-0
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.281
So that's everything that we
need to know about Crash for the

2d6e2f93-32cc-49d4-ad46-b263c3e9c4db-1
00:04:01.281 --> 00:04:01.720
moment.

76f4c84b-1645-4962-bbed-b6b8bc140980-0
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.459
So take a moment, download a
copy of Crash and get connected

76f4c84b-1645-4962-bbed-b6b8bc140980-1
00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:06.440
to your cluster.
