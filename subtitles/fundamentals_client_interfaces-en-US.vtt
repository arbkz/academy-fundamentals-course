b668d798-1784-45b7-b97d-91c5465906c1-0
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.672
You've seen how to interact with
CrateDB using the web-based

b668d798-1784-45b7-b97d-91c5465906c1-1
00:00:08.672 --> 00:00:10.960
console and Crash command line
tools.

6c440ca5-1655-4cdd-bd49-a3e162cd0c84-0
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.383
In this video I'll show you how
to talk to CrateDB using its

6c440ca5-1655-4cdd-bd49-a3e162cd0c84-1
00:00:15.383 --> 00:00:17.280
two primary client interfaces.

507363d5-faf9-4e72-9d85-1d22e882cd80-0
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.080
So let's jump right in.

7649637f-93f7-44c2-bdae-5a314f6a4eac-0
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.560
CrateDB has two main client
interfaces.

6e68799e-25b6-4f30-a868-ed5d6dc5a377-0
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.086
The first of these uses the
PostgreSQL Wire Protocol on port

6e68799e-25b6-4f30-a868-ed5d6dc5a377-1
00:00:29.086 --> 00:00:29.480
5432.

26f73df9-08e1-4c8b-a889-0bc941d73175-0
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.224
Adopting the PostgreSQL Wire Protocol
means that CrateDB is compatible

26f73df9-08e1-4c8b-a889-0bc941d73175-1
00:00:34.224 --> 00:00:37.720
with a wide range of tools and
libraries out-of-the-box.

2e0ff10e-9a10-4908-85e2-52c56fa0f8c0-0
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.825
The other interface is the
HTTP endpoint and it's found

2e0ff10e-9a10-4908-85e2-52c56fa0f8c0-1
00:00:43.825 --> 00:00:44.800
at port 4200.

b47b09eb-183f-4efd-bfe9-2d2a569bedc5-0
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.539
Using this endpoint, you can
submit SQL statements for

b47b09eb-183f-4efd-bfe9-2d2a569bedc5-1
00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:52.600
execution and receive results
back over HTTP.

aa580c62-973c-40bd-a684-c180de4bb926-0
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.795
Both client interfaces can be
secured using Transport Layer

aa580c62-973c-40bd-a684-c180de4bb926-1
00:00:57.795 --> 00:01:01.735
Security and SSL certificates,
but we won't focus on that in

aa580c62-973c-40bd-a684-c180de4bb926-2
00:01:01.735 --> 00:01:02.640
this overview.

f6e0188c-5a6c-4060-afd5-2cfefac06b5f-0
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.076
If you're running CrateDB using
Docker, you might have noticed

f6e0188c-5a6c-4060-afd5-2cfefac06b5f-1
00:01:08.076 --> 00:01:09.200
these ports already.

f67f681f-eceb-4b9f-b215-aa0dd535b818-0
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.376
Here we're telling Docker to map
port 4200 the HTTP interface and

f67f681f-eceb-4b9f-b215-aa0dd535b818-1
00:01:15.376 --> 00:01:20.474
5432 Postgres to the equivalent
port numbers on the host machine

f67f681f-eceb-4b9f-b215-aa0dd535b818-2
00:01:20.474 --> 00:01:22.200
when running CrateDB.

58c1dbd8-b368-434c-9d61-d66f952fe923-0
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.243
This enables you to connect to
the database running in the

58c1dbd8-b368-434c-9d61-d66f952fe923-1
00:01:26.243 --> 00:01:27.960
container using either approach.

82ecafca-28ad-415a-a718-1767d037955d-0
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.431
Support for the Postgres wire
protocol means you can use a

82ecafca-28ad-415a-a718-1767d037955d-1
00:01:33.431 --> 00:01:35.760
variety of tools to connect to
CrateDB.

a807960c-616f-479c-9854-04ed8dee1992-0
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.487
Here I've installed the PostgreSQL
psql command line tool and I'm

a807960c-616f-479c-9854-04ed8dee1992-1
00:01:40.487 --> 00:01:43.760
connecting to a local instance
of CrateDB.

0ee95035-c6ab-4779-bd5e-b8fb01a190ad-0
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.623
I've specified the host and port
that it's running on, as well as

0ee95035-c6ab-4779-bd5e-b8fb01a190ad-1
00:01:48.623 --> 00:01:52.120
the user to connect as and the
default schema to connect to.

1c26804f-1e20-416f-a9df-65785a098581-0
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.062
Note that in Postgres the
default schema is called public,

1c26804f-1e20-416f-a9df-65785a098581-1
00:01:57.062 --> 00:02:01.055
in CrateDB it's doc, so I'm
making sure to pass that in

1c26804f-1e20-416f-a9df-65785a098581-2
00:02:01.055 --> 00:02:01.400
here.

2329da59-f280-4fa7-862f-cd67b4491e51-0
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.400
SQL queries work as you'd
expect.

0ea50d3b-b6bb-46c3-80ea-93b5e0f9c2ea-0
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.010
Here I'm asking CrateDB to tell
me what the most popular types

0ea50d3b-b6bb-46c3-80ea-93b5e0f9c2ea-1
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.320
of car in the Chicago taxi fleet
are.

33826ec6-bb08-4587-a4f3-67b0c722a6e2-0
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.254
The query is sent to CrateDB
on port 5432 using the PostgreSQL

33826ec6-bb08-4587-a4f3-67b0c722a6e2-1
00:02:19.254 --> 00:02:25.405
Wire Protocol and the response
is received and formatted by the

33826ec6-bb08-4587-a4f3-67b0c722a6e2-2
00:02:25.405 --> 00:02:27.520
psql CLI for display.

d25d58d3-2013-4500-a18f-7ffac3ae2dc0-0
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.000
Let's turn our attention to the
HTTP endpoint for a moment.

ad27b7e2-fddb-43ad-ae3c-6bdbfa23e0cb-0
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.480
It's found at /_sql on port
4200 of your CrateDB node.

a9966e59-c355-4e5f-b918-13d601b12081-0
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.089
If you want to use another port
number, you can do this by

a9966e59-c355-4e5f-b918-13d601b12081-1
00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:42.800
changing the node's
configuration.

3114ac5f-8879-4fdd-9b0c-ccc9752b23ed-0
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.543
SQL statements are submitted for
execution by sending a POST

3114ac5f-8879-4fdd-9b0c-ccc9752b23ed-1
00:02:48.543 --> 00:02:52.632
request to the endpoint with the
SQL in the JSON body of the

3114ac5f-8879-4fdd-9b0c-ccc9752b23ed-2
00:02:52.632 --> 00:02:53.160
request.

bb315ca5-79f4-4fd1-a5c0-9e6638fcb9f9-0
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.960
Responses containing results are
returned as JSON too.

96bc0c05-dfb8-4f91-8ead-34873ded87df-0
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.481
You can use parameterised
queries by passing both the SQL

96bc0c05-dfb8-4f91-8ead-34873ded87df-1
00:03:03.481 --> 00:03:07.633
statement and an array of
arguments in the JSON body, and

96bc0c05-dfb8-4f91-8ead-34873ded87df-2
00:03:07.633 --> 00:03:11.504
the HTTP endpoint also
supports bulk operations, for

96bc0c05-dfb8-4f91-8ead-34873ded87df-3
00:03:11.504 --> 00:03:15.304
example to insert several
records in a single request

96bc0c05-dfb8-4f91-8ead-34873ded87df-4
00:03:15.304 --> 00:03:16.360
response cycle.

57e00c6a-4f3d-4770-8325-8b137800b92a-0
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.840
Here's an example HTTP POST that
runs a SELECT statement.

30ee4ca1-1fd1-48c3-8356-e56bef66fb9c-0
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.261
I'm using the curl command line
tool to send this to CrateDB

30ee4ca1-1fd1-48c3-8356-e56bef66fb9c-1
00:03:27.261 --> 00:03:28.120
running locally.

2b468e10-8617-4cf2-8bd0-07ab3f0bc940-0
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.326
You can of course use any API or
HTTP request testing tool, for

2b468e10-8617-4cf2-8bd0-07ab3f0bc940-1
00:03:33.326 --> 00:03:35.360
example Postman or Insomnia.

8d5c8f65-2c03-445b-9e75-cc54f8dc4351-0
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.163
The SQL statement is sent to
CrateDB inside a JSON object

8d5c8f65-2c03-445b-9e75-cc54f8dc4351-1
00:03:42.163 --> 00:03:44.040
with a key named stmt.

888e9ea1-61fc-4c59-8725-46ce8ba0c987-0
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.610
CrateDB executes the statement
and returns a JSON response

888e9ea1-61fc-4c59-8725-46ce8ba0c987-1
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:50.920
containing the result.

07b9eba7-5417-4c67-aac0-6a779182d436-0
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.426
Here the cols array contains
the names of the columns

07b9eba7-5417-4c67-aac0-6a779182d436-1
00:03:55.426 --> 00:03:59.293
returned, and the rows array
contains a further array for

07b9eba7-5417-4c67-aac0-6a779182d436-2
00:03:59.293 --> 00:04:01.960
each matching row. For your
convenience

ba9abb24-37a6-4417-94e0-21b77240ef74-0
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.772
rowcount indicates how many
rows were affected and duration

ba9abb24-37a6-4417-94e0-21b77240ef74-1
00:04:05.772 --> 00:04:09.360
tells you how long the query
took to run in milliseconds.

0c08302f-7ad8-48a2-be69-574af0f557cd-0
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.920
This example inserts 3 records
at once.

adc6098f-d167-4ed5-88d5-210cfd239676-0
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.450
The values are provided in the
bulk_args array in the JSON

adc6098f-d167-4ed5-88d5-210cfd239676-1
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.720
body of the request.

755376f5-c580-4072-a7f0-bdb93cd2b86a-0
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.532
In this video you learnt about
the two client interfaces

755376f5-c580-4072-a7f0-bdb93cd2b86a-1
00:04:26.532 --> 00:04:27.800
offered by CrateDB.

c1e30af2-0128-407d-9f33-e8266023d408-0
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.193
Compatibility with the PostgreSQL
Wire Protocol leads to easy

c1e30af2-0128-407d-9f33-e8266023d408-1
00:04:32.193 --> 00:04:36.200
integration with a wide range of
tools and ecosystems. 

c1e30af2-0128-407d-9f33-e8266023d408-2
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.883
An HTTP endpoint provides an
alternative interface that's

c1e30af2-0128-407d-9f33-e8266023d408-3
00:04:39.883 --> 00:04:44.083
also based on common standards,
meaning ease of access from many

c1e30af2-0128-407d-9f33-e8266023d408-4
00:04:44.083 --> 00:04:45.440
tools and frameworks.

f6a21769-ec28-4ec8-ad48-cb14e1fb1066-0
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.942
Many drivers and SDKs build on
top of these to provide rich,

f6a21769-ec28-4ec8-ad48-cb14e1fb1066-1
00:04:49.942 --> 00:04:54.159
idiomatic interfaces to CrateDB
for popular programming language.

12d20305-020c-447e-95e3-358818774f2a-0
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.080
We'll cover these drivers in a
separate video.

bb452b86-5276-4f65-9701-0fc1b32aaff6-0
00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.225
Take a moment to try out some
queries using the

bb452b86-5276-4f65-9701-0fc1b32aaff6-1
00:05:01.225 --> 00:05:05.029
HTTP endpoint and the sample
data set in your own CrateDB

bb452b86-5276-4f65-9701-0fc1b32aaff6-2
00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.520
cluster.

e9dc412d-4639-4707-a2e6-951804637ce3-0
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.925
Remember you can use the curl
command or tools such as

e9dc412d-4639-4707-a2e6-951804637ce3-1
00:05:09.925 --> 00:05:13.923
Postman, Insomnia or whatever
your favorite API testing tool

e9dc412d-4639-4707-a2e6-951804637ce3-2
00:05:13.923 --> 00:05:14.120
is.
