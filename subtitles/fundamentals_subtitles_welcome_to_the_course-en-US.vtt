00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.824
Hello and welcome to the CrateDB
Fundamentals course here at

e3eb63cf-9b0c-4d82-a43e-3724c92fb349-1
00:00:06.824 --> 00:00:08.120
the CrateDB Academy.

fcf8b1fc-f3d0-46b7-83d6-b24cf1d2af91-0
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.740
My name is Simon Prickett, I
work in Developer Relations, and

fcf8b1fc-f3d0-46b7-83d6-b24cf1d2af91-1
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.160
I'll be your guide and tutor for
this course.

e53303c6-8bb5-49b6-9d0f-9ff663a521fa-0
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.640
Let's begin by looking at the
course structure.

f72bfc0c-3489-4f53-a16a-d10e06ff0858-0
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.480
First of all, this is the
welcome module.

6f3fa08a-f1cf-444f-8420-0427dbeb72d3-0
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.267
I'll show you how the course is
laid out, how it's assessed, and

6f3fa08a-f1cf-444f-8420-0427dbeb72d3-1
00:00:25.267 --> 00:00:27.920
how you can earn a certificate
of completion.

3091a6ca-f5ed-4c54-9f6a-6df59a9f2474-0
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.480
We'll dive straight in and get
you up and running.

5989ed19-645b-4fb2-8088-58fef5f5f69e-0
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.158
So we'll look at what CrateDB
actually is and then we'll

5989ed19-645b-4fb2-8088-58fef5f5f69e-1
00:00:36.158 --> 00:00:37.680
switch to hands on mode.

e27d2d04-56f7-4884-ab8c-1f4b1ccf2c00-0
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.600
You'll get control of a CrateDB
cluster, create one in the cloud

e27d2d04-56f7-4884-ab8c-1f4b1ccf2c00-1
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.440
or locally using Docker and load
some sample data for the course.

eb28a348-8c24-437b-81af-a529b9f63944-0
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.240
We'll then move on to look at
why should we use CrateDB?

b88061e8-2671-4737-9591-710d8f7da147-0
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.000
What are the benefits of it?

e68841c7-3caa-40da-aa7b-0a2cd167b67b-0
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.720
What are the benefits of a multi
model database?

412fe44b-0573-4dc5-b0c4-df7ef1982a8f-0
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.542
And we'll look at some use cases
from customers that are already

412fe44b-0573-4dc5-b0c4-df7ef1982a8f-1
00:00:58.542 --> 00:00:59.800
having success with Crate.

0ef4cf60-2630-4fb6-b57c-138ab78f3ddf-0
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.524
Data modelling is really
important, so we'll spend some

0ef4cf60-2630-4fb6-b57c-138ab78f3ddf-1
00:01:04.524 --> 00:01:05.240
time on this.

00d935f2-e043-485b-bcf7-d61b727d8781-0
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.398
After a brief overview of the
available data types, we'll dig

00d935f2-e043-485b-bcf7-d61b727d8781-1
00:01:09.398 --> 00:01:11.400
deep into time series and documents.

c959a4bb-12d9-43f5-a9a6-613610e3bbaa-0
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.023
We'll look at some vector
similarity search, and we'll

c959a4bb-12d9-43f5-a9a6-613610e3bbaa-1
00:01:15.023 --> 00:01:16.760
also focus on geospatial data.

82c37c81-79e9-4a41-8490-418a16d09320-0
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.088
Once we've seen what we can do
with data in CrateDB, we'll see

82c37c81-79e9-4a41-8490-418a16d09320-1
00:01:22.088 --> 00:01:25.623
how we can get large amounts of
it into the database and work

82c37c81-79e9-4a41-8490-418a16d09320-2
00:01:25.623 --> 00:01:26.080
with it

550601f5-bbbf-4919-b5a6-8a08811ccf9f-0
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.074
once it's there. You'll learn
how to do SQL queries across

550601f5-bbbf-4919-b5a6-8a08811ccf9f-1
00:01:30.074 --> 00:01:33.682
different types of data,
aggregations, and use CrateDB's

550601f5-bbbf-4919-b5a6-8a08811ccf9f-2
00:01:33.682 --> 00:01:35.680
Lucene full text search engine.

38805519-9b03-4328-b387-bb7ea4817546-0
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.003
When building applications that
use CrateDB, it's important to

38805519-9b03-4328-b387-bb7ea4817546-1
00:01:40.003 --> 00:01:43.628
have an understanding of the
different client interfaces and

38805519-9b03-4328-b387-bb7ea4817546-2
00:01:43.628 --> 00:01:47.194
drivers available for popular
programming languages such as

38805519-9b03-4328-b387-bb7ea4817546-3
00:01:47.194 --> 00:01:48.680
Java, Python, or Node.js.

5c7b7aff-af2e-45c1-8d6b-71dd93421650-0
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.645
It's also important to see where
CrateDB fits into a tools and

5c7b7aff-af2e-45c1-8d6b-71dd93421650-1
00:01:53.645 --> 00:01:55.200
integrations ecosystem.

0abcd3e2-8330-4973-9e47-ba304e7448db-0
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.980
If you're going to have success
with CrateDB, you'll want to

0abcd3e2-8330-4973-9e47-ba304e7448db-1
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.880
understand how to operate it at
scale.

069114e2-4c7b-4561-a591-1292f8dcd797-0
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.204
In this module, you'll see what
CrateDB's architecture looks

069114e2-4c7b-4561-a591-1292f8dcd797-1
00:02:05.204 --> 00:02:08.924
like, how it can scale, the
different deployment models, and

069114e2-4c7b-4561-a591-1292f8dcd797-2
00:02:08.924 --> 00:02:12.520
receive some tips for monitoring
and tuning the database.

ff7d05b8-47a4-4554-8f76-9464b6ba540c-0
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.795
Finally, we'll look at some
security concerns, how to secure

ff7d05b8-47a4-4554-8f76-9464b6ba540c-1
00:02:17.795 --> 00:02:19.880
and manage a database in
production.

fdadf7c1-fab7-4eac-951c-381481e119c5-0
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.459
Our course is based around some
example data from the city of

fdadf7c1-fab7-4eac-951c-381481e119c5-1
00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.040
Chicago in the United States.

f0e8183d-3dbf-4c8e-ad36-891bbbbc828c-0
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.224
We have data sets for taxis, so
the vehicles that operate

f0e8183d-3dbf-4c8e-ad36-891bbbbc828c-1
00:02:31.224 --> 00:02:34.622
various taxi rides and services
in the city, the rides

f0e8183d-3dbf-4c8e-ad36-891bbbbc828c-2
00:02:34.622 --> 00:02:37.960
themselves, so which vehicle
went where at what time.

bad59ccd-0a36-4797-8d38-71eb3a00fc71-0
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.272
We have some Geo data about the
different neighbourhoods that

bad59ccd-0a36-4797-8d38-71eb3a00fc71-1
00:02:42.272 --> 00:02:46.229
make up the city of Chicago and
we have a large data set of 311

bad59ccd-0a36-4797-8d38-71eb3a00fc71-2
00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.600
calls.

25bacfa4-21dc-4c4e-90ff-afb6b7ba3a7f-0
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.865
These are non-emergency calls
for things like there's a

25bacfa4-21dc-4c4e-90ff-afb6b7ba3a7f-1
00:02:49.865 --> 00:02:53.480
pothole in the road, or there's
an animal barking, or there's

25bacfa4-21dc-4c4e-90ff-afb6b7ba3a7f-2
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.880
too much aircraft noise.

90009da0-b981-49bd-b344-0e346657d3bd-0
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.816
We'll see how we can use CrateDB
to combine all of these

90009da0-b981-49bd-b344-0e346657d3bd-1
00:02:58.816 --> 00:03:01.320
different data sources into rich
queries.

4e5bc5e9-91ee-4159-8dd7-67540daefb3b-0
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.360
Your course is assessed in two
ways.

a1d9ef81-2b3b-4fe7-ab20-966d9da33fe7-0
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.120
Throughout the course, there are
quizzes.

fe41b3ed-85fc-4437-872a-6511331590fa-0
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.320
These are multiple choice
questions.

a0f35885-cc83-403b-aa46-95ec87c40b96-0
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.083
They're not graded, and they're
there to check your

a0f35885-cc83-403b-aa46-95ec87c40b96-1
00:03:14.083 --> 00:03:16.520
understanding of the module
you've just completed.

6359b5b7-e3ab-4779-9083-e14c09684031-0
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.520
You can attempt them as many
times as you like.

84aecc97-de5d-44ab-97dc-a4f718b7a9cd-0
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.200
At the end of the course is your
final exam.

ec64e73a-6595-4675-95f6-f0719fdce701-0
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.432
The final exam consists of a
number of questions that are in

ec64e73a-6595-4675-95f6-f0719fdce701-1
00:03:27.432 --> 00:03:31.531
the same multiple choice format
as the quizzes, but this time

ec64e73a-6595-4675-95f6-f0719fdce701-2
00:03:31.531 --> 00:03:32.920
they're graded. Again,

e0caec9d-c49d-451b-b7bb-2b93d854fb18-0
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.407
you can take them as many times
as you like, and you're free to

e0caec9d-c49d-451b-b7bb-2b93d854fb18-1
00:03:36.407 --> 00:03:39.895
reference external materials as
well as the course content when

e0caec9d-c49d-451b-b7bb-2b93d854fb18-2
00:03:39.895 --> 00:03:40.439
answering.

138dcdcc-ec26-4aca-85a3-4463d581e56d-0
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.394
If you score 75% or higher on
your final exam, you can earn a

138dcdcc-ec26-4aca-85a3-4463d581e56d-1
00:03:46.394 --> 00:03:48.120
certificate of completion.

655d4b24-1369-4300-8246-0d214aec63fd-0
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.522
This can be added to your
LinkedIn profile to demonstrate

655d4b24-1369-4300-8246-0d214aec63fd-1
00:03:51.522 --> 00:03:53.560
to the world your knowledge of
CrateDB.

38f79176-2dec-4cdb-bd6a-29d9768cce78-0
00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.526
If you need help or want to talk
to us about CrateDB, then we

38f79176-2dec-4cdb-bd6a-29d9768cce78-1
00:04:00.526 --> 00:04:03.715

8497594f-b8fc-418e-9b84-8b864b3b8801-0
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.752
There's a section for the
Academy to ask questions about

8497594f-b8fc-418e-9b84-8b864b3b8801-1
00:04:08.752 --> 00:04:11.824
these courses, but there are
also other sections for all

8497594f-b8fc-418e-9b84-8b864b3b8801-2
00:04:11.824 --> 00:04:13.279
things to do with CrateDB.

27feb646-e3ba-4f8d-ab8e-2167605b3f30-0
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.501
So whether your question is to
do with SQL or a particular

27feb646-e3ba-4f8d-ab8e-2167605b3f30-1
00:04:16.501 --> 00:04:19.836
programming language or you just
want to share a project or some

27feb646-e3ba-4f8d-ab8e-2167605b3f30-2
00:04:19.836 --> 00:04:22.914
success that you've had using
CrateDB, we'd love to hear from

27feb646-e3ba-4f8d-ab8e-2167605b3f30-3
00:04:22.914 --> 00:04:23.119
you.
