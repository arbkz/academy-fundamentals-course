00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.555
In this short video, I'll show
you how CrateDB fits seamlessly  

46855576-c767-4224-bb23-6c67c99ccfba-1
00:00:08.555 --> 00:00:12.360
into a wider ecosystem of third
party tools and frameworks.

fddf537d-bef2-4b96-bf5c-e019fab470bb-0
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.291
Many of these integrations are
made possible through CrateDB's

fddf537d-bef2-4b96-bf5c-e019fab470bb-1
00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:18.760
adoption of the PostgreSQL
wire protocol.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.768
This is a huge topic, and I'll
only be able to scratch the

2ddd3379-ee8d-439c-a28f-07d37e372b8d-1
00:00:22.768 --> 00:00:23.440
surface here.

9af98c67-ce5e-4a2a-8ea9-010b89db0d6f-0
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.330
If you're interested in a
specific integration that's not

9af98c67-ce5e-4a2a-8ea9-010b89db0d6f-1
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.707
mentioned in this video, check
out the associated resources,

9af98c67-ce5e-4a2a-8ea9-010b89db0d6f-2
00:00:30.707 --> 00:00:33.419
which include links to the
relevant parts of the

9af98c67-ce5e-4a2a-8ea9-010b89db0d6f-3
00:00:33.419 --> 00:00:35.800
documentation containing much
more detail.

2affc37f-55cf-41ad-96b3-7822e26603c3-0
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.085
Let's spend a few minutes
reviewing some of the most

2affc37f-55cf-41ad-96b3-7822e26603c3-1
00:00:40.085 --> 00:00:41.680
popular tools and integrations.

0ffaa73a-8c84-406e-8f62-fe031a12aa99-0
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.023
As CrateDB uses standard SQL to
insert, update, and query data,

0ffaa73a-8c84-406e-8f62-fe031a12aa99-1
00:00:48.023 --> 00:00:52.310
it's a natural fit into a wide
ecosystem of tools, frameworks,

0ffaa73a-8c84-406e-8f62-fe031a12aa99-2
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.079
and programming languages.

e7a67fdd-e3f0-47aa-9816-08afdd0ce971-0
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.444
Streaming data can be ingested
and indexed at speed from

e7a67fdd-e3f0-47aa-9816-08afdd0ce971-1
00:00:59.444 --> 00:01:03.915
message brokers such as Kafka or
Apache Flink, as well as MQTT

e7a67fdd-e3f0-47aa-9816-08afdd0ce971-2
00:01:03.915 --> 00:01:05.760
brokers including HiveMQ.

94d56f30-22c6-49e2-8864-00b832f82e58-0
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.618
CrateDB fits into your workflow
when using platforms such as

94d56f30-22c6-49e2-8864-00b832f82e58-1
00:01:10.618 --> 00:01:14.437
Apache Airflow, and of course,
many other tools and platforms

94d56f30-22c6-49e2-8864-00b832f82e58-2
00:01:14.437 --> 00:01:17.640
that support Postgres will also
work with CrateDB.

dc8e54de-b071-4ff5-9e2a-1ec569cd62ed-0
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.016
Once stored in CrateDB, data
can be accessed from a wide

dc8e54de-b071-4ff5-9e2a-1ec569cd62ed-1
00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:24.880
variety of tools and frameworks.

20e73f0b-d634-4e35-8a9c-b4a65d1901bd-0
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.908
These include popular
visualisation tools such as

20e73f0b-d634-4e35-8a9c-b4a65d1901bd-1
00:01:28.908 --> 00:01:30.960
Grafana, Tableau, and Power BI.

113702fe-e145-412f-8f8e-37155088f316-0
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.747
And don't forget that with
drivers and SDKs for all of the

113702fe-e145-412f-8f8e-37155088f316-1
00:01:35.747 --> 00:01:39.539
popular programming languages,
you can also easily integrate

113702fe-e145-412f-8f8e-37155088f316-2
00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:41.840
CrateDB into your own
applications.

e0f86bbb-65e7-4f05-b37b-341abee82211-0
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.506
We've spoken about CrateDB's
Postgres compatibility a lot

e0f86bbb-65e7-4f05-b37b-341abee82211-1
00:01:47.506 --> 00:01:51.461
here, but don't forget that
there's also the HTTP endpoint

e0f86bbb-65e7-4f05-b37b-341abee82211-2
00:01:51.461 --> 00:01:55.417
that opens up more integration
possibilities, especially for

e0f86bbb-65e7-4f05-b37b-341abee82211-3
00:01:55.417 --> 00:01:56.520
bulk data ingest.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.907
For the remainder of this video,
I'll show you how to access data

11ffb177-bb9f-4586-a1f0-90fb301a56e7-1
00:02:00.907 --> 00:02:04.255
in CrateDB from a few popular
tools that you might already be

11ffb177-bb9f-4586-a1f0-90fb301a56e7-2
00:02:04.255 --> 00:02:04.999
familiar with.

67b74c98-7e65-44c4-8d3d-5e790cd31431-0
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.527
CrateDB has its own command
line tool Crash and is also

67b74c98-7e65-44c4-8d3d-5e790cd31431-1
00:02:11.527 --> 00:02:15.400
compatible with the Postgres 
psql command line interface.

f3d4e6e6-1d6a-4f29-aa1e-455f1ec15e7f-0
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.444
Sometimes you want to take a
more graphical approach to

f3d4e6e6-1d6a-4f29-aa1e-455f1ec15e7f-1
00:02:19.444 --> 00:02:20.680
managing your databases.

eb214a36-8bb5-498a-a62d-9103933afb90-0
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.164
Here I've connected the popular
DBeaver tool to CrateDB and

eb214a36-8bb5-498a-a62d-9103933afb90-1
00:02:25.164 --> 00:02:28.642
you can see the data contained
in the taxis table from our

eb214a36-8bb5-498a-a62d-9103933afb90-2
00:02:28.642 --> 00:02:29.680
Chicago data set.

c8f4a4d0-e36a-4c3f-8594-29905141e27a-0
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.241
If you have a preferred database
management tool that supports

c8f4a4d0-e36a-4c3f-8594-29905141e27a-1
00:02:34.241 --> 00:02:37.280
Postgres, you should be able to
use it with CrateDB.

675e327d-ca6f-4152-bfeb-1bae3e27c85a-0
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.640
Application developers will be
pleased to know that you can

675e327d-ca6f-4152-bfeb-1bae3e27c85a-1
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.120
access data in CrateDB
directly from many popular IDE's.

a4e517f0-08bf-4e52-abca-4866aae550af-0
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.915
Here I'm running a query that
summarises data in the taxis

a4e517f0-08bf-4e52-abca-4866aae550af-1
00:02:51.915 --> 00:02:56.429
table from a Chicago sample data
set, and I'm doing it right here

a4e517f0-08bf-4e52-abca-4866aae550af-2
00:02:56.429 --> 00:03:00.396
inside the popular VS Code IDE
using Microsoft's Postgres

a4e517f0-08bf-4e52-abca-4866aae550af-3

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.146
Grafana is a popular
visualisation and dashboard

905551cc-7767-44b9-804f-d67f00cde592-1
00:03:07.146 --> 00:03:08.080

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.103
You can use Grafana both to
understand the performance of

dfc445d5-6549-46a0-be87-9fe4901c059f-1
00:03:12.103 --> 00:03:15.468
your CrateDB cluster and to
visualise data stored in the

dfc445d5-6549-46a0-be87-9fe4901c059f-2
00:03:15.468 --> 00:03:16.000

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.930
This dashboard shows a map of
all of the open street light

1adeb6ec-7a2b-4c8e-9289-8e08969853ab-1
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.640
issues in Chicago using data
from a three_eleven_calls table.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.720
And here's the simple SQL query
that powers it.

79199ebe-279a-463e-9e70-d5b7274039fe-0
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.325
You can add data from a CrateDB
cluster to Grafana using

79199ebe-279a-463e-9e70-d5b7274039fe-1
00:03:33.325 --> 00:03:35.840
Grafana's Postgres data source
plug in.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.032
And finally, don't forget that
there are drivers and SDK's for

ce20b833-b1d1-4632-b420-a72cbbc1bb75-1
00:03:41.032 --> 00:03:43.200
most popular programming
languages.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.561
Several languages have multiple
options depending on your coding

650cceb0-7327-40e6-b6c7-bd3d09f00d92-1
00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:50.520
style and the level of
abstraction you're working at.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.696
Here are some examples for
Python, Node.js, Java, .NET, Go,

94ed7b8a-ccf0-47a2-9d39-5f5e673127ec-1
00:03:57.696 --> 00:03:58.560

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.820
In this video I only have time
to scratch the surface of what's

7fb285b8-b8c4-482a-b4d4-d12961766e53-1
00:04:04.820 --> 0:04:08.880
possible when integrating CrateDB
with party tools and systems.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.040
Hopefully I've given you a
flavour of what you can do.
