00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.888
In this video, you'll learn how
to sign up for the CrateDB

b5eac908-99fc-4cb8-a93e-a745664866e8-1
00:00:07.888 --> 00:00:11.256
Cloud, create a new database
cluster, and retrieve your

b5eac908-99fc-4cb8-a93e-a745664866e8-2
00:00:11.256 --> 00:00:12.640
connection credentials.

43f90dd4-4634-4dc4-bef4-b3a502fd2cb5-0
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.600
So let's just dive on in and get
started.

a7bd3d5e-719e-4b7c-8a74-5f12dcf72a2b-0
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.480
We're going to begin here at the
CrateDB website.

2cbda615-7f68-42fa-9cd5-a2fe1c04ea4f-0
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.600
So take your browser to
cratedb.com and then you're

2cbda615-7f68-42fa-9cd5-a2fe1c04ea4f-1
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.200
going to click on this Get
Started button in the top right.

22ca26ce-3318-4e97-833f-5a39ac579f14-0
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.760
And we want to go with the CrateDB
Cloud option today.

00fb72c2-a1cf-47df-8516-5417838303b6-0
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.880
As you'll see, we can start for
free.

4f87b983-e37b-4508-9c0f-2a51e67d5fdb-0
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.808
So click Start for free and
you'll be taken here to the

4f87b983-e37b-4508-9c0f-2a51e67d5fdb-1
00:00:37.808 --> 00:00:40.360
CrateDB Cloud Console login.

68acf7e6-e91d-4283-9189-d9ee98cde1c0-0
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.554
You won't have an account at
this point, so you'll need to

68acf7e6-e91d-4283-9189-d9ee98cde1c0-1
00:00:43.554 --> 00:00:43.960
sign up.

ab6cd856-874b-4f2e-b4b3-8cb88365765f-0
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.578
You can choose to sign up with
one of the social services, so

ab6cd856-874b-4f2e-b4b3-8cb88365765f-1
00:00:48.578 --> 00:00:52.814
GitHub, Google, or Microsoft, or
you can just pick a username and

ab6cd856-874b-4f2e-b4b3-8cb88365765f-2
00:00:52.814 --> 00:00:53.520
a password.

da80ce0c-00b5-44d7-84c1-e2b8cd3b7191-0
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.362
Whichever one you choose, you're
going to be sent an e-mail with

da80ce0c-00b5-44d7-84c1-e2b8cd3b7191-1
00:00:58.362 --> 00:01:01.560
a verification code and that's
got a link in it.

8d13630a-04bf-4843-ab37-d9d938425238-0
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.369
Once you receive that e-mail,
click the link and you'll come

8d13630a-04bf-4843-ab37-d9d938425238-1
00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.840
back to the Cloud Console.

1a7d12af-fc2f-4152-8e52-799fb4e4d431-0
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.104
As you can see here, I'm now
signed in and the first thing we

1a7d12af-fc2f-4152-8e52-799fb4e4d431-1
00:01:12.104 --> 00:01:16.000
need to do when we're a new user
is create an organization.

aa064201-f477-4e13-b8f8-0f80dad5841a-0
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.214
Think of this as like a company
or something that you want to

aa064201-f477-4e13-b8f8-0f80dad5841a-1
00:01:20.214 --> 00:01:23.280
keep all of your database
clusters organised under.

fbd25ed4-1b22-4671-96d6-5d3b9c8a3d1c-0
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.534
So go ahead here and enter your
company name or your own name or

fbd25ed4-1b22-4671-96d6-5d3b9c8a3d1c-1
00:01:27.534 --> 00:01:30.480
whatever you want to call your
organization.

55f6c5aa-25b2-4ed7-a6fb-1923fcdc76c5-0
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.862
I'm going to call mine CrateDB
as that's where I work, and I'm

55f6c5aa-25b2-4ed7-a6fb-1923fcdc76c5-1
00:01:34.862 --> 00:01:37.080
going to click create
organization.

4c57134e-27a6-44d8-b161-ddb090d8591d-0
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.880
So as you can see, that's
happened.

cdb0cc8d-5691-4989-82c6-31c14d7f0e75-0
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.040
We've now created an
organization.

cc21d862-075d-49af-8029-119a37435b35-0
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.950
It's like a holding container
for clusters and there are no

cc21d862-075d-49af-8029-119a37435b35-1
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.840
clusters in it at the moment.

818d39c1-0c49-4282-9223-634b56b2d528-0
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.146
So the next thing we want to do
is go ahead and deploy a

818d39c1-0c49-4282-9223-634b56b2d528-1
00:01:52.146 --> 00:01:52.560
cluster.

4d01c0a9-8853-470b-87ac-318128148c5e-0
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.880
So we'll click the button there
and here we get some choices.

a8289ce0-bb1c-4fb3-bef7-5d8881d8f748-0
00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.272
So for production, we might want
to vary things here and select

a8289ce0-bb1c-4fb3-bef7-5d8881d8f748-1
00:02:01.272 --> 00:02:03.040
some of the other options.

01b445c0-648b-4e9a-9fb2-1abace099e0c-0
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.944
As we're going with the free
trial option here, we're going

01b445c0-648b-4e9a-9fb2-1abace099e0c-1
00:02:06.944 --> 00:02:10.751
to basically select a simple
database and we're not going to

01b445c0-648b-4e9a-9fb2-1abace099e0c-2
00:02:10.751 --> 00:02:12.000
be charged for this.

d309f47a-cd20-4450-8976-e850bb391cfa-0
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.640
So here we're going to stay on
shared.

28ee5cc8-27c3-4742-b964-11ed8f93c730-0
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.578
We're going to stick with this
CR3 size here, which as you'll

28ee5cc8-27c3-4742-b964-11ed8f93c730-1
00:02:18.578 --> 00:02:19.240
see is free.

419f457e-7038-4db0-a7c9-b48c60b34d91-0
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.871
We're not going to be charged
for it and there's no need to

419f457e-7038-4db0-a7c9-b48c60b34d91-1
00:02:21.871 --> 00:02:22.880
enter a payment method.

5ebb8413-29e5-4b9d-a4d5-a1b2f4d050f2-0
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.835
And one thing we can choose is
let's look at the available

5ebb8413-29e5-4b9d-a4d5-a1b2f4d050f2-1
00:02:27.835 --> 00:02:29.200
clouds and regions.

3d133ffd-b499-4185-9c0f-6f558f8ba19b-0
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.014
So this database cluster can be
built in a cloud of your choice

3d133ffd-b499-4185-9c0f-6f558f8ba19b-1
00:02:34.014 --> 00:02:37.360
in a region near you from the
ones available.

cee01467-fc0f-4297-ad6f-09478c7d56d9-0
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.803
So I'm in the UK, so I'm going
to choose AWS Europe, Ireland

cee01467-fc0f-4297-ad6f-09478c7d56d9-1
00:02:40.803 --> 00:02:44.374
here because that's closest to
me, which might be important for

cee01467-fc0f-4297-ad6f-09478c7d56d9-2
00:02:44.374 --> 00:02:47.945
keeping latency down when you're
building an application in the

cee01467-fc0f-4297-ad6f-09478c7d56d9-3
00:02:47.945 --> 00:02:48.280
cloud.

62b38fee-9b29-410f-a5d8-5515e9a3de4a-0
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.552
Next, I can give the cluster a
name, or I can go with this one

62b38fee-9b29-410f-a5d8-5515e9a3de4a-1
00:02:53.552 --> 00:02:54.920
that's been picked for me.

31f48d8d-7d11-45c1-bf0e-031aea9f4a2b-0
00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.402
I'm just going to call this my
cluster, but we can call it

31f48d8d-7d11-45c1-bf0e-031aea9f4a2b-1
00:03:00.402 --> 00:03:01.160
anything.

f951d515-ba89-4970-ab33-6fbf873b4ba4-0
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.089
Then once we're done, we're
ready to click this deploy

f951d515-ba89-4970-ab33-6fbf873b4ba4-1
00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:08.280
cluster button and we'll get
asked a simple question.

9ee582de-eecd-43d0-959f-4051955ae058-0
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.520
What are we planning on using
the cluster for?

1fa564f2-432b-48a7-a008-41169d9cca90-0
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.374
I'm actually going to use this
to take a course on CrateDB

1fa564f2-432b-48a7-a008-41169d9cca90-1
00:03:14.374 --> 00:03:14.760
Academy.

79883536-379d-4a0e-808d-794a37c66a57-0
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.840
So I'll select other for now and
hit deploy the cluster.

9e447c4b-a349-490c-aff2-dd9a5f2316b1-0
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.818
So what we see now is that the
cluster is being deployed and

9e447c4b-a349-490c-aff2-dd9a5f2316b1-1
00:03:22.818 --> 00:03:25.200
we've already got some login
credentials.

dbafb5aa-5857-4721-8659-95e23f4db071-0
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.960
So these are secrets.

72e71565-8447-49ab-826c-e5a2358f53d6-0
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.520
You shouldn't share them with
people.

3b34c2c1-ad30-4896-82a3-e8a2e228eff1-0
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.688
I'm not going to show them on
the screen, but you can click

3b34c2c1-ad30-4896-82a3-e8a2e228eff1-1
00:03:31.688 --> 00:03:34.805
the download button here and
that will download all of the

3b34c2c1-ad30-4896-82a3-e8a2e228eff1-2
00:03:34.805 --> 00:03:38.079
credentials that you need to
connect to this database cluster

3b34c2c1-ad30-4896-82a3-e8a2e228eff1-3
00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.399
once it's up and running.

3760523d-10bb-415d-ad31-de990d0aadcd-0
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.714
That will include the host name,
the port, the username, and the

3760523d-10bb-415d-ad31-de990d0aadcd-1
00:03:43.714 --> 00:03:44.240
password.

5bd34421-2d13-4d16-b8b7-5aea803e248a-0
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.600
As you can see here, the cluster
is currently being deployed.

82ca7d76-ec13-4ee9-8a65-d986d42108e5-0
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.650
So while that's happening, we'll
scroll down and see what we've

82ca7d76-ec13-4ee9-8a65-d986d42108e5-1
00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:52.080
got here.

56362cbf-f16f-46f5-808e-b2f9adbc4a35-0
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.480
We've got some information about
how to connect to the cluster.

5dd78d09-92e8-4e4d-a408-d4844ce89f7f-0
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.740
So these are the things that are
in that text file that you can

5dd78d09-92e8-4e4d-a408-d4844ce89f7f-1
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.320
download from the button above.

1bc531ca-2760-438e-8ada-57f477bacf2e-0
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.214
Again, we don't see the password
because we're not going to share

1bc531ca-2760-438e-8ada-57f477bacf2e-1
00:04:04.214 --> 00:04:04.440
that.

dfca51da-3965-4424-a8d0-5735f2562e7b-0
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.214
If you want to see how you might
connect to your cluster from

dfca51da-3965-4424-a8d0-5735f2562e7b-1
00:04:08.214 --> 00:04:11.500
different programming languages,
there's examples here with your

dfca51da-3965-4424-a8d0-5735f2562e7b-2
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.320
clusters details already
completed.

6b459252-a189-4481-a2ae-0f66c7e93f2a-0
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:19.467
So this one, for example, is
Python, this one is Node.js, and

6b459252-a189-4481-a2ae-0f66c7e93f2a-1
00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:22.640
this one is using our Crash CLI.

6d90d72f-6682-48b6-ad15-c83b5d8d5719-0
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.840
So clusters still being
deployed.

f46110a8-773a-433c-90b8-91f7e07d961a-0
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.986
So when that finishes up, we'll
go ahead and have a look at the

f46110a8-773a-433c-90b8-91f7e07d961a-1
00:04:28.986 --> 00:04:29.360
console.

05ba398c-9920-444c-bf80-f3109165edc0-0
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.160
Okay, so our cluster is now
deployed.

efd18ac6-728b-4bb3-bda4-2d2538b39aa1-0
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.649
We can see there we have a green
light and it says healthy as of

efd18ac6-728b-4bb3-bda4-2d2538b39aa1-1
00:04:35.649 --> 00:04:38.280
a few seconds ago, so it should
be ready to use.

3126bd37-ad40-42fa-8b86-d6cb0748adf4-0
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.384
So let's go ahead and launch the
console over here on the left we

3126bd37-ad40-42fa-8b86-d6cb0748adf4-1
00:04:43.384 --> 00:04:45.000
have a console menu item.

29a415fb-753a-471a-8b0a-45132204dc0a-0
