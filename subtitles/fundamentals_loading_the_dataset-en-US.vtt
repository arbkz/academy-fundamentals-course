8eb15941-c2d1-4780-9a8f-7b7829007767-0
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.453
Now it's time to create your
first table and insert some data

8eb15941-c2d1-4780-9a8f-7b7829007767-1
00:00:07.453 --> 00:00:09.080
into your CrateDB cluster.

ae19ab68-21eb-4490-a840-0cbdadb495b5-0
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.480
Let's get started.

5eb94fca-8a8c-4f96-b63d-1aa3f8501603-0
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.321
Here I'm using the Cloud Console, so
with my cloud database, I've

5eb94fca-8a8c-4f96-b63d-1aa3f8501603-1
00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:18.840
selected console over here on
the left.

1c4c373f-48d3-4dec-95fa-d9b330e3cdab-0
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.452
And this is an interface that
allows us to enter SQL

1c4c373f-48d3-4dec-95fa-d9b330e3cdab-1
00:00:22.452 --> 00:00:24.360
commands similar to the Crash
CLI.

0da45635-4583-4f1c-8728-822f9fb0db4e-0
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.867
We could also do these commands
in the Crash CLI, but I wanted

0da45635-4583-4f1c-8728-822f9fb0db4e-1
00:00:27.867 --> 00:00:29.840
to show you the console in this
video.

8eb5b0d0-cdd7-4d10-aee4-5ab92ec9bac4-0
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.041
If you're working with Docker,
you'll see a slightly different

8eb5b0d0-cdd7-4d10-aee4-5ab92ec9bac4-1
00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:39.023
interface, so you'll go to local
host port 4200, and you'll click

8eb5b0d0-cdd7-4d10-aee4-5ab92ec9bac4-2
00:00:39.023 --> 00:00:41.920
on this symbol over here, which
is the console.

03283371-53fa-4c7c-aab3-193ec12fdf67-0
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.360
From here, the process is
identical.

7d11eb15-4b9b-49dd-a66a-e4a6efae17b1-0
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.340
You just enter the SQL
commands that I'm going to show

7d11eb15-4b9b-49dd-a66a-e4a6efae17b1-1
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.000
in the cloud.

ac689827-e613-4299-bf8d-7d89b8374d62-0
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.200
So first thing we need to do is
create a table.

55effceb-51f3-4e72-b0b6-b5c7bb764dc2-0
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.928
I've got some SQL in the
clipboard, so I'm going to go

55effceb-51f3-4e72-b0b6-b5c7bb764dc2-1
00:00:56.928 --> 00:00:58.920
ahead and paste that and we'll
see.

0734ad80-3cf8-4511-8b83-4f3503613286-0
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.280
We're creating a table here
called taxis.

a2b18f97-a87e-40b5-8e65-22eeb6f8d856-0
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.592
It has some fields that describe
vehicles that are taxis in the

a2b18f97-a87e-40b5-8e65-22eeb6f8d856-1
00:01:05.592 --> 00:01:06.640
city of Chicago.

7ff20b9b-c8b8-425f-8da9-f601f1d0174e-0
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.245
We're going to give them an id, a
status field, make model and

7ff20b9b-c8b8-425f-8da9-f601f1d0174e-1
00:01:10.245 --> 00:01:13.850
model years, some information
about the vehicle itself, what

7ff20b9b-c8b8-425f-8da9-f601f1d0174e-2
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.278
colour it is, what fuel it
takes, whether it's wheelchair

7ff20b9b-c8b8-425f-8da9-f601f1d0174e-3
00:01:17.278 --> 00:01:18.519
accessible, etc.

eb0c8d06-8d54-46cf-98f4-c1dd4a6baa5f-0
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.179
If I press execute here, that
will go ahead and create the

eb0c8d06-8d54-46cf-98f4-c1dd4a6baa5f-1
00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.560
table.

22c7d9f7-ea0e-473b-aa0b-bb8320e9cb00-0
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.425
We can see what's happened, and
here in the doc schema we now

22c7d9f7-ea0e-473b-aa0b-bb8320e9cb00-1
00:01:27.425 --> 00:01:30.480
have a table called taxis and we
can look at it.

098c655e-e617-482e-9ed3-d9fb75e7a31f-0
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.692
So what we need to do next is go
ahead and load up some data into

098c655e-e617-482e-9ed3-d9fb75e7a31f-1
00:01:35.692 --> 00:01:39.720
our table because there's
currently nothing there.

80c134d2-8899-4523-9cfd-05946814119c-0
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.574
One of the ways that CrateDB
allows us to load data is by

80c134d2-8899-4523-9cfd-05946814119c-1
00:01:44.574 --> 00:01:46.240
copying it in from URLs.

97a3131e-a459-4481-9251-f843955c86a6-0
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.320
So we've got a URL that
represents a CSV file that

97a3131e-a459-4481-9251-f843955c86a6-1
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.600
contains data for our Chicago
Taxi data set, and we can see

97a3131e-a459-4481-9251-f843955c86a6-2
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.480
that here.

e392c2fb-2f5e-48f2-9a50-e58fa73fd639-0
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.000
The link for this will be in
your workbook.

fdea14c8-871d-436e-a1f1-2ff3db6690f4-0
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.761
What I need to do is copy this
link and I'm going to paste that

fdea14c8-871d-436e-a1f1-2ff3db6690f4-1
00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:07.440
into a SQL command.

9957c2c2-455a-4111-8124-6c4d2215c096-0
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.093
What I'm going to say is copy
and then the table name, tap

9957c2c2-455a-4111-8124-6c4d2215c096-1
00:02:13.093 --> 00:02:13.640
these.

5691c97a-724a-46fb-9b13-6f3b407eb6c1-0
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.225
That's the table we're going to
put the data into from then

5691c97a-724a-46fb-9b13-6f3b407eb6c1-1
00:02:17.225 --> 00:02:18.600
where it's coming from.

6fcae874-a633-4d56-b795-82171b1f450e-0
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.280
So this URL here and then I'm
going to say return summary.

ef408536-f068-45b5-948e-e4e3f3a3f2f5-0
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.271
So I'm going to ask CrateDB to
return me a summary of what

ef408536-f068-45b5-948e-e4e3f3a3f2f5-1
00:02:27.271 --> 00:02:31.062
happened when it attempted to
load all of these CSV records

ef408536-f068-45b5-948e-e4e3f3a3f2f5-2
00:02:31.062 --> 00:02:32.199
into the database.

29f4405b-7de7-422e-b5a6-900a77a00409-0
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.710
Let's click execute and you'll
see here we have a success count

29f4405b-7de7-422e-b5a6-900a77a00409-1
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.240
and an error count.

403047be-b702-400d-985d-87827d48564a-0
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.720
I have 2655 records loaded with
no errors.

9579f821-986a-4cea-993a-2061f637b6ec-0
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.440
That's what we want to see, no
errors.

f068c353-f231-4b1a-8816-9b6b15056f36-0
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.800
We can now go ahead and query
the data.

0efec49b-9f04-40fb-b5bc-e38c7d32dfba-0
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.440
Having created that table, it's
now time to write our first

0efec49b-9f04-40fb-b5bc-e38c7d32dfba-1
00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.240
query again.

20118421-aa70-43cd-9572-9d18146f5dc9-0
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.385
I have this in the clipboard,
and we're going to ask CrateDB

20118421-aa70-43cd-9572-9d18146f5dc9-1
00:03:01.385 --> 00:03:05.465
how many of each type of make
and model of taxi are there in

20118421-aa70-43cd-9572-9d18146f5dc9-2
00:03:05.465 --> 00:03:06.000
Chicago.

44ff4eeb-305c-4394-a861-d9221d0798f6-0
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.400
Which ones are the popular ones?

00783546-3875-403a-b620-435115f64f71-0
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.595
So we're going to ask it to
order them by the number of

00783546-3875-403a-b620-435115f64f71-1
00:03:10.595 --> 00:03:11.280
occurrences.

ed951d36-58c9-4c64-89ef-48ef4dc29a40-0
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.946
So what we see here is that the
Toyota Camry is clearly the most

ed951d36-58c9-4c64-89ef-48ef4dc29a40-1
00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:17.640
popular taxi.

e9560144-8616-4ecd-aaaa-d145122a5ecf-0
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.120
There's 1098 of those, followed
by the Prius and the Sienna.

063b2a00-46ca-43bc-a87c-59e33a479b9b-0
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.360
And most of the popular vehicles
here are all Toyotas.

aca79819-70b9-44dc-af68-ba9b09f51961-0
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.400
So what we've got here is a very
basic query that we've run.

d2681092-4aa1-4457-a835-a9fc1aec2d82-0
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.913
We've created a table and we've
copied data from a source on the

d2681092-4aa1-4457-a835-a9fc1aec2d82-1
00:03:34.913 --> 00:03:37.800
Internet, which in this case was
a GitHub repository.

ceccdd7c-515e-422e-9bdc-312bb65968c2-0
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.007
You'll now need to work through
all of the commands in your

ceccdd7c-515e-422e-9bdc-312bb65968c2-1
00:03:42.007 --> 00:03:44.680
workbook to install the data set
for this course.
